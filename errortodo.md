# Error and TODO Tracking - CRM Ultra

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All major integration issues have been identified and resolved during the development process orchestration.

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ 1. Function Redeclaration Error - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: `formatBytes()` function was redeclared multiple times
- **Location**: AppServiceProvider.php, SettingsController.php, backup view JavaScript
- **Solution**: 
  - Created dedicated helpers.php file
  - Updated composer.json autoloader
  - Fixed JavaScript/PHP mixing in views
  - Used global helper function consistently

### ✅ 2. Migration Conflicts - RESOLVED  
- **Issue**: Duplicate migration files for export_requests and custom_reports tables
- **Location**: database/migrations/
- **Solution**:
  - Removed duplicate migration files
  - Applied pending migrations successfully
  - All new models (ConsentLog, DataRequest, DataRetentionPolicy, ExportRequest, Revenue) migrated

### ✅ 3. Seeder Data Type Issues - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Array data being inserted directly into JSON columns
- **Location**: SystemSettingsSeeder.php
- **Solution**: 
  - JSON-encoded array values for json type fields
  - Updated seeder to use updateOrCreate for duplicate handling
  - Fixed PerformanceMetricSeeder schema mismatch

### ✅ 4. Policy Integration - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: New policies needed to be registered
- **Status**: CustomReportPolicy and ExportRequestPolicy already registered in AuthServiceProvider

### ✅ 5. Route Integration - RESOLVED
- **Status**: All new controller routes properly defined in web.php
- **Controllers**: ComplianceController, CustomReportController, ExportController
- **Navigation**: Sidebar properly updated with new sections
