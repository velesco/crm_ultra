## 📋 **TODO - Next Development Priorities** 🚧

#### 🔄 **Admin Views Bootstrap → Tailwind CSS Migration** 🆕 **CRITICAL**
Toate view-urile din panoul admin au fost create cu Bootstrap CSS, dar proiectul folosește **Tailwind CSS**. Toate acestea trebuie refăcute pentru consistență:

**📁 Admin Views ce necesită refacere cu Tailwind CSS:**

🔲 resources/views/admin/security/ (2 views) - Security center
🔲 resources/views/admin/api-keys/ (4 views) - API key management
🔲 resources/views/admin/webhook-logs/ (4 views) - Webhook logs
🔲 resources/views/admin/queue-monitor/ (2 views) - Queue monitoring
🔲 resources/views/admin/performance/ (2 views) - Performance metrics

```

**📊 Total Views to Convert: ~48 admin views** 🚨 **15 VIEWS CONVERTED** ✅

**🎯 Migration Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1**: Core admin views (dashboard, user management, system logs)
2. **Phase 2**: Security & monitoring views (security, api-keys, webhooks, performance)
3. **Phase 3**: Business intelligence views (analytics, revenue, reports, compliance)
4. **Phase 4**: Export & maintenance views (exports, remaining admin features)

**🔧 Technical Requirements:**
- Maintain exact same functionality and features
- Convert all Bootstrap classes to equivalent Tailwind CSS
- Preserve all JavaScript functionality and AJAX calls
- Keep responsive design and mobile-first approach
- Update all interactive components (modals, dropdowns, forms)
- Maintain dark mode compatibility
- Preserve all Chart.js integrations and visualizations
- Keep accessibility features and semantic HTML

**💡 Conversion Guidelines:**
- Bootstrap containers → Tailwind container classes
- Bootstrap grid system → Tailwind grid/flexbox
- Bootstrap buttons → Tailwind button styles with custom components
- Bootstrap forms → Tailwind form styles
- Bootstrap cards → Tailwind card components
- Bootstrap modals → Tailwind modal implementations
- Bootstrap alerts → Tailwind alert components
- Bootstrap badges → Tailwind badge styles
